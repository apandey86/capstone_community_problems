However, we will not apply that filter on twitter data because the model is already generalized and if people are talking about a certain product, we would like to see that as a modelled topic. Hence, our custom tokenizer will be slightly modified here to eliminate `filter_ls` conditional."

However, tweet at `index 4103` in the figure above is one of the examples where the model gets confused. Although the tweet does have words/phrases with negative connotation like `cannot stop`, `never end` but the tweet is not negative nor a complaint. Hence, **semantic based modelling, rather than on words and sequence of words, must be noted as a future improvement** but overall model does a good job and detects complaints and really negative texts."

Both models identify `Long term care` as one of the keywords in most popular topic `report` as one of the keywords in second most popular topic. However, **when used with Counvectorizer**, model has a **higher log likelihood** and **lower model perplexity**, indicating it to be a better model.<br>Interpretation is a problem with both forms of LDA models above as a lot of keywords are generic and also the keywords are not ordered in a way that they provide for a summary of the topic. In the next steps we will work on a way to manually interpret these topic keywords by mapping a dominant topic to each document in the corpus."

    "It is clear from the visualizations above that `spacy entities` are very focused. However, entities do not account for topics that were identified by LDA like `long term health` and `mental health` etc. An ideal approach to address this problem is text summarization that provides both entities and topics but until that, we will use a combination of both entity recognition and topic modelling as they both serve differnt purpose and cannot be an alternative to each other. First stpe will be extract all topics from greivances followed by entity recognition to dig deeper and get a better idea of each topic."
