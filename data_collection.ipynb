Infact positive tweets being a mix of positive and neutral tweets is actually good for the model as the scope of our model is to distinguinsh grievances i.e. complaints, concerns, protests and overly negative tweets from other tweets i.e. positive or neutral. Neutral tweets labelled as 0 however will add some noise, which will be addressed by adding more data points, from other datasets, that comprise of negative texts like complaints and bad reviews.<br>Since the scope of our model is primarily to calssify greivances, we will change all 0 labels to **1 which means that the tweet/text can be classified as greivance** and 4 labels to **0 which means not greivance**. \n"

When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.</td>\n",

       "2  I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.   \n",

I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.</td>\n",

       "2  I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again."

       "      <td>I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n't even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else 's number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying '' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX 's boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me. This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any institution wanting my business for anything.</td>\n",

       "903980  I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n't even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else 's number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying '' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX 's boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me. This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any institution wanting my business for anything.   \n",
       "903982  I had a debit that was included in my chapter XXXX BK, almost two years letter this item showed on my credit reports under collection status for Midwest Recovery Systems. This dropped my credit score XXXX points. I called them and they said their client had n't informed them that it was included in BK, but the damage had already been done. It took them 30 days to remove this incorrectly put item on my credit reports. Its still showing up on my XXXX. I thought this was against the law for them to do that since I am protected by BK laws. They should be fined for this. I should sue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "      <td>I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n't even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else 's number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying '' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX 's boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \\r\\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \\r\\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \\r\\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me. This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any institution wanting my business for anything.</td>\n",

XXXX does not show any claim for {$1200.00} ; therefore it was never sent/received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "199968  I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n't even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else 's number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying '' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX 's boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \\r\\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \\r\\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \\r\\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me. This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any institution wanting my business for anything.   \n",
       "199969  I had a debit that was included in my chapter XXXX BK, almost two years letter this item showed on my credit reports under collection status for Midwest Recovery Systems. This dropped my credit score XXXX points. I called them and they said their client had n't informed them that it was included in BK, but the damage had already been done. It took them 30 days to remove this incorrectly put item on my credit reports. Its still showing up on my XXXX. I thought this was against the law for them to do that since I am protected by BK laws. They should be fined for this.

       "   'Content': 'While the T3 is a pretty easy camera to use, there are a lot of hidden features and tricks I would probably never have discovered without this book. Chapter 3 starts out with...\"One thing that surprises new owners of the Canon EOS Rebel T3 is that the camera has a total of 496 buttons, dials, switches, levers, latches, and knobs bristling from it\\'s surface. Okay, I lied. Actually, the real number is closer to two dozen controls and adjustments, but that\\'s still a lot of components to master, especially when you consider that many of these controls serve double-duty to give you access to multiple functions.\"This quote serves two purposes here; to illustrate that this is not just a dry reference manual and to point out that there are in fact quite a few bells and whistles that the camera has to offer. I\\'ve actually found this book to be an enjoyable read; however I also spend a lot of my time studying military standards which can make just about anything else seem interesting! While it may seem time consuming to read a book geared to just one camera, it\\'s actually a time saver if you really want to know how to get the most out of your T3.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'This is the latest of Busch\\'s best-of-breed guidebooks, offering a comprehensive manual for the Canon EOS Rebel T3 entry-level digital SLR. The T3 is a basic 12-megapixel model that lacks some features and the high price tag of more luxe beginner cameras like the T3i, but its affordability will attract beginners who want a camera with room to grow into.  Busch\\'s book has the information you need to learn and grow, supplying easy explanations of using the T3\\'s basic features accompanied by simple introductions to the kind of more advanced capabilities that will help even the rawest neophyte take the best pictures of their lives. Although very accessible, this book goes much deeper than the run-of-the-mill camera guides to offer advice on how to use every control, select every menu option.. The author\\'s friendly style leads you through the camera\\'s features and tells you not only what each capability does, but gives examples of when you\\'ll get the most benefit from using it. Busch explains all the new features for the D5100 in a way that\\'s easy to understand. His novel approach is to condense all the essential information about each and every control on the camera into a multi-page \"roadmap\" that explains their functions without the need to leap around from page to page, as is the case with the Canon manual. He devotes several full chapters to outlining every menu option, and actually provides much more detail than you\\'ll find in most of the other \"expanded\" guides for the T3.Although this book is comprehensive, it\\'s easy reading, and if you want a condensed version to carry around with you, Busch offers that too. His David Busch\\'s Compact Field Guide for the Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D is a worthy replacement for those laminated cheat sheets that fold out into six index card sized tabs with one-sentence summaries of most of the menu settings, too. While the portable version duplicates some of the information found in this book, the two make a great pair for home and field. You\\'ll want to buy them both to have the information you need on the go and for study at home.',\n",

       "   'Content': \"I had never used or even purchased a dSLR before and was debating on buying the T3/1100D. I was looking at various guides and this one really stood out. I breezed through others but it was David Busch's guide I bought. I actually bought his guide to field work which is rally helpful too.This book was the deciding factor on whether I wanted the t3 or not. I did all of my research read through all of the reviews on the T3 however I did not know how comfortable I would feel with this camera. I could play with it all day at the store but if I couldn't understand from the guide and from my own level compentency it just wouldn't be the purchase for me.David Busch really did a great job. This book is for everyone no matter how skilled you are with the dSLR already. I felt immediately comfortable and truly felt like I was understanding and grasping his directions. He did not assume anything on the readers part nor did he speak down to the reader.I have since added several other books of his to my wish list. I have this one on my kindle but I think I will be buying it in paperback as well just to have a backup incase I want to flip or highlight anything on actual paper. I have since followed him on his blog and become a very big fan of his writing. I may not know everything heck or even 1% about photography but I do feel that it is something I can learn and am not thinking it is an impossible task anymore thanks to Busch's books\",\n",

       "   'Content': 'Although this book is similar in layout and much content to the author\\'s T3i guide, owners of the entry-level T3 model need this version, because the features of the two cameras don\\'t completely overlap.  This one is written specifically for the T3, and is easily the best available guide for this camera. A quick glance through this innovative book shows that Busch is the world\\'s best-selling camera guide author for a reason. His books are a cut above the other books, which all repeat what you see in the book packaged with the camera, without going into any depth on how to use them. This one, although compact and portable,  is different, with Busch\\'s trademark friendly introduction to the Canon EOS Rebel T3, accessible to anyone -- novice to veteran -- who wants to learn how to use the camera quickly. In that respect, it\\'s great for beginners. But the author is especially skilled at taking you beyond the basics to explain exactly how to apply the features of the T3 to improve your photographic skills.Individual chapters of the book explore the finer points of exposure, including the use of histograms, understanding the T3\\'s autofocus options, HD movie-making, and creative ways to use lenses and light. There are thirteen chapters in all, each of them dealing with a different aspect of using the EOS T3. Even the general material on topics like f/stops and exposure all relate directly to his camera.This book is especially good for those who feel they are \"visually oriented.\" These folks tend to gravitate to DVD instruction, not realizing that such productions are basically audio programs with images, and aren\\'t really visually oriented at all. With a DVD, you\\'re basically using your ears to listen to a talking head explain the camera, and what you hear may not sink in immediately. Busch\\'s guide takes the right visual approach, using large full-color illustrations accompanied by the text you need to quickly understand what the author is explaining. We\\'ve reviewed several of Busch\\'s guides, and, after reading this one, still wonder why all camera guides aren\\'t this good.',\n",

       "   'Content': 'I purchased my Rebel T3 about a month ago and am in love with this camera.  It is my first dSLR and I have a lot to learn as a newbie.  I\\'ve identified a wonderful photography forum at Ugly Hedgehog.com and enjoy seeing photos and reading how photographers caught their shots.  Many links are provided to hundreds of websites for further information.  This has been fun but overwhelming in trying to learn the ins and outs of dSLR and specifically my T3, just because of the massive amount of information that is available and so much of it that is not applicable to my T3.  However, what I gained most was one user stating that \"anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to get David Busch\\'s Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography\".  My search led me to Amazon and after reading the first chapter free, I was hooked.  I purchased the Kindle version so I have it to take with me as needed.  It is easy to read and the picture quality is good, even though it is in black and white only.  Having it on my computer Kindle library is like getting 2 books for the price of one.  The large computer colored screen view with fantastic quality pictures is a real plus.  As to the quality of the information the author provides, I find it exceptionally easy to understand.  He really does make me feel like he is sitting down with me and showing me how to use my new camera and all of its features.  I just made my purchase today and am so pleased with it.  This is one book that I know I will read cover to cover and will have as a much used reference book in the future.  I agree... anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to have this book.',\n",

Actually, the real number is closer to two dozen controls and adjustments, but that\\'s still a lot of components to master, especially when you consider that many of these controls serve double-duty to give you access to multiple functions.\"This quote serves two purposes here; to illustrate that this is not just a dry reference manual and to point out that there are in fact quite a few bells and whistles that the camera has to offer. I\\'ve actually found this book to be an enjoyable read; however I also spend a lot of my time studying military standards which can make just about anything else seem interesting! While it may seem time consuming to read a book geared to just one camera, it\\'s actually a time saver if you really want to know how to get the most out of your T3.',\n",

       "  'Content': 'This is the latest of Busch\\'s best-of-breed guidebooks, offering a comprehensive manual for the Canon EOS Rebel T3 entry-level digital SLR. The T3 is a basic 12-megapixel model that lacks some features and the high price tag of more luxe beginner cameras like the T3i, but its affordability will attract beginners who want a camera with room to grow into.  Busch\\'s book has the information you need to learn and grow, supplying easy explanations of using the T3\\'s basic features accompanied by simple introductions to the kind of more advanced capabilities that will help even the rawest neophyte take the best pictures of their lives. Although very accessible, this book goes much deeper than the run-of-the-mill camera guides to offer advice on how to use every control, select every menu option.. The author\\'s friendly style leads you through the camera\\'s features and tells you not only what each capability does, but gives examples of when you\\'ll get the most benefit from using it. Busch explains all the new features for the D5100 in a way that\\'s easy to understand. His novel approach is to condense all the essential information about each and every control on the camera into a multi-page \"roadmap\" that explains their functions without the need to leap around from page to page, as is the case with the Canon manual. He devotes several full chapters to outlining every menu option, and actually provides much more detail than you\\'ll find in most of the other \"expanded\" guides for the T3.Although this book is comprehensive, it\\'s easy reading, and if you want a condensed version to carry around with you, Busch offers that too. His David Busch\\'s Compact Field Guide for the Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D is a worthy replacement for those laminated cheat sheets that fold out into six index card sized tabs with one-sentence summaries of most of the menu settings, too. While the portable version duplicates some of the information found in this book, the two make a great pair for home and field. You\\'ll want to buy them both to have the information you need on the go and for study at home.',\n",

       "  'Content': \"I had never used or even purchased a dSLR before and was debating on buying the T3/1100D. I was looking at various guides and this one really stood out. I breezed through others but it was David Busch's guide I bought. I actually bought his guide to field work which is rally helpful too.This book was the deciding factor on whether I wanted the t3 or not. I did all of my research read through all of the reviews on the T3 however I did not know how comfortable I would feel with this camera. I could play with it all day at the store but if I couldn't understand from the guide and from my own level compentency it just wouldn't be the purchase for me.David Busch really did a great job. This book is for everyone no matter how skilled you are with the dSLR already. I felt immediately comfortable and truly felt like I was understanding and grasping his directions. He did not assume anything on the readers part nor did he speak down to the reader.I have since added several other books of his to my wish list. I have this one on my kindle but I think I will be buying it in paperback as well just to have a backup incase I want to flip or highlight anything on actual paper. I have since followed him on his blog and become a very big fan of his writing. I may not know everything heck or even 1% about photography but I do feel that it is something I can learn and am not thinking it is an impossible task anymore thanks to Busch's books\",\n",

       "  'Content': 'Although this book is similar in layout and much content to the author\\'s T3i guide, owners of the entry-level T3 model need this version, because the features of the two cameras don\\'t completely overlap.  This one is written specifically for the T3, and is easily the best available guide for this camera. A quick glance through this innovative book shows that Busch is the world\\'s best-selling camera guide author for a reason. His books are a cut above the other books, which all repeat what you see in the book packaged with the camera, without going into any depth on how to use them. This one, although compact and portable,  is different, with Busch\\'s trademark friendly introduction to the Canon EOS Rebel T3, accessible to anyone -- novice to veteran -- who wants to learn how to use the camera quickly. In that respect, it\\'s great for beginners. But the author is especially skilled at taking you beyond the basics to explain exactly how to apply the features of the T3 to improve your photographic skills.Individual chapters of the book explore the finer points of exposure, including the use of histograms, understanding the T3\\'s autofocus options, HD movie-making, and creative ways to use lenses and light. There are thirteen chapters in all, each of them dealing with a different aspect of using the EOS T3. Even the general material on topics like f/stops and exposure all relate directly to his camera.This book is especially good for those who feel they are \"visually oriented.\" These folks tend to gravitate to DVD instruction, not realizing that such productions are basically audio programs with images, and aren\\'t really visually oriented at all. With a DVD, you\\'re basically using your ears to listen to a talking head explain the camera, and what you hear may not sink in immediately. Busch\\'s guide takes the right visual approach, using large full-color illustrations accompanied by the text you need to quickly understand what the author is explaining. We\\'ve reviewed several of Busch\\'s guides, and, after reading this one, still wonder why all camera guides aren\\'t this good.',\n",

       "  'Content': 'I purchased my Rebel T3 about a month ago and am in love with this camera.  It is my first dSLR and I have a lot to learn as a newbie.  I\\'ve identified a wonderful photography forum at Ugly Hedgehog.com and enjoy seeing photos and reading how photographers caught their shots.  Many links are provided to hundreds of websites for further information.  This has been fun but overwhelming in trying to learn the ins and outs of dSLR and specifically my T3, just because of the massive amount of information that is available and so much of it that is not applicable to my T3.  However, what I gained most was one user stating that \"anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to get David Busch\\'s Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography\".  My search led me to Amazon and after reading the first chapter free, I was hooked.  I purchased the Kindle version so I have it to take with me as needed.  It is easy to read and the picture quality is good, even though it is in black and white only.  Having it on my computer Kindle library is like getting 2 books for the price of one.  The large computer colored screen view with fantastic quality pictures is a real plus.  As to the quality of the information the author provides, I find it exceptionally easy to understand.  He really does make me feel like he is sitting down with me and showing me how to use my new camera and all of its features.  I just made my purchase today and am so pleased with it.  This is one book that I know I will read cover to cover and will have as a much used reference book in the future.  I agree... anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to have this book.',\n",

They are handsomely printed on durable stock with a protective coating for years of shuffling. I've been making my own for over twenty years, but the result has never approached the artful and clear design of these sturdy and compact cards. Students of linguistics should also find these cards useful for developing fluency in IPA transcription.The transcription of the example words for English is a nice compromise between overly broad and unnecessarily narrow. Diacritics, for example, are largely limited to markers of length and syllabicity. A General American accent is the model; primary and secondary stress are marked, as are syllable boundaries. For most ESOL/EFL teachers (at least in the US), the 43 cards covering all the sounds of American English will get the most use, and they are conveniently color-coded (Deck 2) to distinguish them from the rest. Linguistics students will likely spend more time with the other two decks, one with the symbol on one side and its phonetic description on the reverse, and the other giving the names for the individual symbols. The decision to separate into decks and package all three decks together was both generous and wise: for a slightly higher price, you have the capability to accurately describe the languages of any of your students, even if they hail from South Sudan!One might complain that a tool for teaching the sounds of a language should actually make those sounds audibly. (Perhaps the folks at Minokidowinan already have an app for the iPhone in the works!) But really, the task to which these flashcards are best suited is improving the fluency of phonetic transcription, which is, after all, necessarily a written exercise.</td>\n",

These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating.  The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name.  This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate.  The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely!  I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!</td>\n",

That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all.

They are broken down into 3 different flash card types, each one helpful in its own way to mastering the phonetics of the world's languages.  My only disclaimer would be that these cards do require some base-level prerequisite linguistic knowledge.  For example, one set of the cards provides the IPA symbol on one side and the description of the sound on the other.  If you are not familiar with basic phrases used in phonetics like \"central, back, closed, rounded,\" etc... you may have to do some research before using the cards, because there is not an in-depth explanation on the cards.  It is this simplicity and organization of the cards that I actually greatly appreciate.  Lastly, these cards may seem a little pricey... I will say that I think it is worth it.  These cards are made to last and they are a great tool for learning, teaching, using with non-native speakers of a language, using for students learning other languages, etc.  I would recommend these cards to anyone interested in linguistics, learning a new language, or teaching.</td>\n",

       "0  English teachers who work with native speakers of other languages will be thrilled with these flash cards. They are handsomely printed on durable stock with a protective coating for years of shuffling. I've been making my own for over twenty years, but the result has never approached the artful and clear design of these sturdy and compact cards. Students of linguistics should also find these cards useful for developing fluency in IPA transcription.The transcription of the example words for English is a nice compromise between overly broad and unnecessarily narrow. Diacritics, for example, are largely limited to markers of length and syllabicity. A General American accent is the model; primary and secondary stress are marked, as are syllable boundaries. For most ESOL/EFL teachers (at least in the US), the 43 cards covering all the sounds of American English will get the most use, and they are conveniently color-coded (Deck 2) to distinguish them from the rest. Linguistics students will likely spend more time with the other two decks, one with the symbol on one side and its phonetic description on the reverse, and the other giving the names for the individual symbols. The decision to separate into decks and package all three decks together was both generous and wise: for a slightly higher price, you have the capability to accurately describe the languages of any of your students, even if they hail from South Sudan!One might complain that a tool for teaching the sounds of a language should actually make those sounds audibly. (Perhaps the folks at Minokidowinan already have an app for the iPhone in the works!) But really, the task to which these flashcards are best suited is improving the fluency of phonetic transcription, which is, after all, necessarily a written exercise.   \n",
       "1  While I have a pretty limited knowledge of phonetics/linguistics as a formal discipline, I entered a drawing to win a set of  these cards, because although I have rudimentary knowledge about the IPA, I have always been very interested in it.  These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating.  The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name.  This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate.  The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely!  I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2  I'm starting my Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language so I wanted something to help me with studying the phonetic alphabet.  These cards are ok, but I wish for the price they would have a little more information.  They give you the mere basics you would expect from flash cards and do not give much more explanation.  That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all.  SO not a bad set, but I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth than they are.  Other than that they are made well and have a good organization system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3  As one with a Bachelor's in Linguistics and much exposure to the world's languages, I have to say these flash cards are excellent.  They are broken down into 3 different flash card types, each one helpful in its own way to mastering the phonetics of the world's languages.  My only disclaimer would be that these cards do require some base-level prerequisite linguistic knowledge.  For example, one set of the cards provides the IPA symbol on one side and the description of the sound on the other.  If you are not familiar with basic phrases used in phonetics like \"central, back, closed, rounded,\" etc... you may have to do some research before using the cards, because there is not an in-depth explanation on the cards.  It is this simplicity and organization of the cards that I actually greatly appreciate.  Lastly, these cards may seem a little pricey... I will say that I think it is worth it.  These cards are made to last and they are a great tool for learning, teaching, using with non-native speakers of a language, using for students learning other languages, etc.  I would recommend these cards to anyone interested in linguistics, learning a new language, or teaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
