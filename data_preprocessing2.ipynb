    "5. Replace punctuations with whitespace - For intial model we will focus on key words to determine negative tweets.\n",
    "6. Remove numbers\n",
    "7. Trim repeated letters in a word - People tend to use mutiple letters to emphasize especially on twitter e.g. I am soooooooooo hungryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Any letter repeating more than twice will be trimmed. Hence, the mentioned text will be modified to I am soo hungryy.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>It must be noted that it is very important to complete steps 1 through 3 before replacing punctuations with whitespace because they all include some form of punctuation like @,#,// etc. that will be removed and alphanumeric values are left unchanged. e.g. \"http://twitpic.com/5ej4y - My favorite neurotic sister\" will be transformed to \"http   twitpic com 5ej4y   My favorite neurotic sister\"\n",
