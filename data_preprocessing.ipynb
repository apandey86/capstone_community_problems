I wanna try the motion detection alarm with photos I receive of activity it detects. You can't beat it for the price anywhere! Video quality looks excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1116493  After looking over different brands of IP camera and finally found this, it looks great and the spec of is better than many other IP camera at the same price.follow up:3/29/2014: after receiving the camera, I open up the box and the Camera looks nice.I set up the camera right out of box,the whole process was very easy, just follow the instruction that come with the camera. it took me a about 10 minutes to set  every things up plus download  the app on App Store. I control the camera with my Ipad 2 and  it works great in the bright and dark. from this point I did not see any issue with this camera, but I will keep update my review about this product in future.   \n",
