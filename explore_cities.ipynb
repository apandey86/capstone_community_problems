For example `hate` keyword from original topic can be associated with people not being happy about Charles McVety's islamophobia and homophobia. It must also be noted that in 1st visualization for `PERSON` entity islamophobia and homophobia have also been wrongly classified as `PERSON`. Hence, the identified entities must not be treated strictly as entities but rather sub key words within each topic that help analyze that topic further."

    "Classification model has shown good accuracy on classifying tweets from cities. However, the model is fairly naive as it looks for certain words and sequences that it picked from train dataset and hence gets confused with sarcasm and in certain other cases where negative words but the context is positive. It can be improved further by adding semantics. Overall the model does a good job classifying most negative/greivance tweets.<br>Topic modelling with CountVectorizer does a good job identifying key words that are representative of community greivances and does give user a glimpse. However, a lot of manual inspection is still needed to completely understand the keywords and the labelled tweets have to be revisited which defeats the purpose of extracting a summary of greivances of from labelled tweets. This problem can be addressed by employing a text summarization model.<br>Also this analysis must be exteneded to other social media platforms like reddit, quora etc., as well, as we have seen from tweets patterns from 2 Canadian cities that there are not enough tweets with a retweet filter of 25. Moving the filter any lower will just add tweets that do not convey much meaning and just add noise to the model. Hence, the dataset must be enriched by collecting data from other sources as well."
